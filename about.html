<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>

  Hello! I’m Abhinav Singh Choudhary,
  currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at IPS College,
  Gwalior. My journey into the world of tech is driven by my curiosity
  and passion for solving problems through programming.
  With a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms,
  I'm also delving into Web Development and Data Science to broaden my
  skill set and contribute meaningfully to tech projects.
  </p>

<p>I’ve always had a love for exploring different fields,
  whether it’s through anime, which gives me creative inspiration,
  or by staying updated with geopolitics, which sharpens my critical thinking. Balancing academics with practical skill-building,
  I am actively involved in projects that require collaboration, leadership,
  and innovation.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m honing my skills in Java with DSA, Web Development,
  and improving my habits to be more productive and efficient in my goals.
  I believe that discipline, continuous learning,
  and a passion for technology will help me make a lasting impact in the tech industry</p>

<p>
  In my free time,
  I enjoy watching anime and exploring new web development frameworks.
  I’m always up for a challenge and excited to see where
  my passion for technology takes me next!.
